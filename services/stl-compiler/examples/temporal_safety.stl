temporal_safety
// Temporal safety specification with Always and Eventually operators
G[0,10] voltage > 220 && F[0,5] current < 100
param: voltage_threshold real 220.0 Voltage safety threshold
param: current_threshold real 100.0 Current safety threshold
param: time_window real 10.0 Time window for safety check
constraint: voltage_bounds bounds voltage <= 250.0
constraint: current_bounds bounds current <= 120.0
constraint: temporal_consistency temporal G[0,1] voltage > 200
